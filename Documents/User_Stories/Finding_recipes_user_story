Browsing and filtering Recipes

When I log in and click the "Search for recipes" button, I can see the weather forecast for the next week based on my current location.
If I am not logged in, I must log in first (see Authenticating_user_story).
When I click the "Find recipes" button, I can see the suggested recipes for each day along with their ingredients,
as well as the reasons for choosing these ingredients like nutrient composition, whether the food is in season, etc.
If I want to see new recipes, I can click "Find more recipes", which has replaced the "Find recipes" Button. 
A list of new recipes will appear. If I want to filter my results with some preferences, I can click the "Filter" tab,
which will have a list of boxes that I can check to filter by, such as "Vegetarian" or "Mexican cuisine".

See Going_shopping_user_story for adding recipes and going shopping.
