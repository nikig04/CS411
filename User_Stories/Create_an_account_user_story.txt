Creating an account

I'm in the "Sign-in" page, and I'm a new user who wants to create an account. I click the "New User?" and get 
directed into "Create an account" page. On this page, I can either click "Sign in with Google", at which point I will be asked for my
google account credentials, or I can create local credentials by clicking "Create a new account". If i click "Create a new account",
The first field asks for email address. The second field asks for username. Third field asks for password. 
Fourth field asks for name (to be used in my profile). Once I finish signing in through google or inputting values into the fields
, I click the "Create my account!" button and am directed back into the "Sign-in" page.
