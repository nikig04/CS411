Creating an account

I'm in the "Sign-in" page, and I'm a new user who wants to create an account. I click the "New User?" and get 
directed into "Create an account" page. On this page, there are four fields. The first field asks for email address. 
The second field asks for username. Third field asks for password. Fourth field asks for name (to be used in my profile). 
After filling these four fields out, I click the "Create my account!" button and am directed back into the "Sign-in" page.
