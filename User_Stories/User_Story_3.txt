Going shopping

If I click "Add recipe" for each recipe that I decide to make, the website will add the ingredients to a list. 
When I am finished adding recipes, I can click "Go shopping", and the website will show me my final list, separated by recipe, and suggest nearby grocery stores to go to.
If I want to check the prices of any ingredient, I can click on the ingredient and it will show me the price at nearby grocery stores. 
There will also be a price estimate at the bottom of the list for my entire list.
