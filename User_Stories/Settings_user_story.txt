Viewing	and Editing My Info



After I	authenticate my	information and	log in for the first time, I am	immediately taken to the settings screen. This is where I will include general personalized information about myself including gender, age. 

I will also be asked about my food choices including the kinds of meat I consume and how healthy I want to be. I can always reference back to this settings page to change any food choices and I can also edit the list of my favorite recipes here. 

My favorite recipes will be added if I make a dish and enjoy it. It provides a way for me to go back to the dished I liked eating.
