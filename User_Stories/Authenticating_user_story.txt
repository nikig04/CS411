Authenticating and authorizing your account

When I open the website, I want to log in and see my account. There is a hyperlink called "Sign into account" at the top right
which takes me into the "Sign-in" page. If I don't already have an account and I want to create one, 
there is a hyperlink called "New user?" that connects to the "Create an account" page. For creating an account, see
Create_an_account_user_story. At the center of the sign-in page, there are two fields, and an option to sign in with Google.
If I click sign in with Google, it will ask me for my google account information, and once filling that out,
I am taken to "My Profile page". If I choose to sign in with local credentials, the top field asks for my username,
and the bottom field asks for my password. After inputting my username and password, I click the
button "Log in" and I am taken to "My Profile" page. See "Settings_user_story" for more information on viewing and editing profile.
