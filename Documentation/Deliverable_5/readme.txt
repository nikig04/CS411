Deliverable 5 required three things:
An in-class demonstration
An ERD for our database
A sequence diagram for our API call

We've included the ERD and sequence diagram in Deliverable_5_First. In Deliverable_5_Final, we've included one file,
which is the updated ERD. The API call actually remained the same from when we made the sequence diagram, so nothing about it needs to be updated.
