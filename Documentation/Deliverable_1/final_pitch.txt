As our initial proposed idea, Feather is an application that provides users recipe suggestions based on the weather in their current location. We are cross-referencing the food recipe API Spoonacular with the popular weather API Open Weather. The algorithm for our suggestions vary with the weather. For example, if it’s going to be a really cold incoming week, the app would recommend recipes that are good for cold weather. If it’s rainy, it’d suggest recipes good for wet, rainy days and if it’s hot, it’ll look for refreshing and cold foods. In addition, if the weather is simply moderate then we will recommend recipes based on what is in season. The benefits still stand, of making your own food vs eating out. This is evidently more beneficial as it is not only easier to make healthier choices but it is more budget-friendly. With this app, consumers who are trending towards more health-conscious and cost-friendly foods can buy groceries for the coming week and prepare meals in advance knowing full well what they would enjoy in the days to come. We have modified the main functionality to only include the search option for recipes and suggestions for certain days of the week.
