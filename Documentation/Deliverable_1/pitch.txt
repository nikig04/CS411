Main: Food/Weather App
We would cross-reference food recipe APIs such as the Food, Yummly, and Meal
Plantastic with popular weather APIs like Weather Underground, World Weather Online, and
Forecast.io in order to provide recipe suggestions based on the weather. For example, if it’s
going to be a really cold incoming week, the app would recommend recipes that are good for
cold weather. If it’s rainy, it’d suggest recipes good for wet, rainy days and if it’s hot, it’d look
for refreshing and cold foods. The benefits of making your own food vs eating out is evident as it
is not only easier to make healthier choices but it is more budget-friendly. With this app,
consumers who are trending towards more health-conscious and cost-friendly foods can buy
groceriwes for the coming week and prepare meals in advance knowing full well what they
would enjoy in the days to come. Main functionality is searching for recipes and suggestions for
certain days of the week but extra stuff we’re thinking of including is a way to mark your
favorite recipes, a way to edit items in your shopping list based on the recipes you’ve chosen,
and local stores that stock the items/potential sales.

Backup: Lucky Lunch App
For the spontaneous and fun-loving consumers, this app could help pick out your lunch.
The app generates a wheel or some sort of graphical design to help you decide where to get
lunch! We can use the Yahoo Local Search API and input your zip code and optionally the
type(s) of cuisine you want. With this information, a wheel with all the options near you will be
generated and within seconds, will help you make a decision that would otherwise have taken
you much longer. More functionality includes suggesting meals of the day in the area and/or 
keeping track of your food history to make sure you’re not suggested to eat pizza or pasta every
day of the week.
