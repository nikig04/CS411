Going shopping

After searching for recipes (see Finding_recipes_user_story), If I click "Add recipe" for each recipe that I decide to make,
the web app will add the ingredients to a list. When I am finished adding recipes, I can click "Go shopping",
and the website will show me my final list, separated by recipe, and suggest nearby grocery stores to go to.
I can cross out all the ingredients I already have at home. If I want to check the prices of any ingredient,
I can click on the ingredient and it will show me the price at nearby grocery stores. 
There will also be a price estimate at the bottom of the list for my entire list.
