When I login and click the "Search for recipes" button, I am redirected to a new “Recipes” page. There I can find a search box where I am prompted to enter a zip code. If I do not enter a valid zip code, I am given an error that says “Please input a valid zip code”. When I enter a valid zip code I can see a loading bar while my recipes load. Once the recipes have loaded, I can see the average weather and forecast for the next week based on my current location. Along with the weather I am given three recipes per day, the name of the recipe, the link to the recipe, and the ingredients for each recipe.  If I am not logged in, I must log in first (see Authenticating_user_story). If I search that same zip code again, a list of new recipes will appear.
