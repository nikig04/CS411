We unfortunately did not have time to figure out how to implement the functionality of adding ingredients to a list (see additional artifacts in the docs folder). Instead, every recipe has a link to a page with the full instructions, and every recipe also has all of the ingredients listed, so the user can just copy them into a text document if they want to make an ingredient list.
