I'm in the “Login” page, and I'm a new user who wants to create an account. I click the "New to our site? Sign up!" and get directed into "Create an account" page. On this page, there are six fields. The first field asks for username. It has restrictions that include 150 characters or fewer. Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only. It is also a required field. The second and third field asks for my first and last name. Both of these are also required and have no further restrictions. The fourth field asks for a valid email address which is required as well. The fifth and final field asks for a password and a confirmation of the password. The password must be 8 character and the the confirmation password must match. After filling these six fields out, I click the "Sign Up" button and am directed to the “Home” page where I am greeted by first name.
