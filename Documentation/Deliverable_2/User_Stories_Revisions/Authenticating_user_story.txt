Final- Authenticating and authorizing your account				
			
As soon as I get to the Feather webpage, I see a option to Login or “New to our site? Sign up!” As a new user I click on the hyperlink which takes me into the "Sign-up" page (For creating an account, see Create_an_account_user_story). At the center of the sign-in page, there are two fields, and an option to sign in with Facebook. If I click sign in with Facebook, it will ask me for my facebook account information, and once filling that out, I am taken to the "Home". If I choose to sign in with local credentials, the top field asks for my username, and the bottom field asks for my password. After inputting my username and password, I click the button "Log in" and I am taken to the "Home" page. The “Home” page greets me by my first name.
