Happy Path:
1A: Chooses local account / 1B: Chooses Google
2A: Authentication request sent to database / 2B: Request app 
3A: Returns token / 3B: Return app token
(4-6 if choosing Google):
4: Redirected to home page
5: Google requests Login roken
6: Authenticated through google
7: Store session ID
8: Complete --> Redirect with session


Somethings that could go wrong:

1- No account
   Refreshes and redirects to a sign up page
2- Incorrect password or username
   Refreshes and allows re-enter of both for a period of 3 tries. After that there is a time out session. 
   If there is a valid user attached to the username, an email is sent to that user informing about the situation.
3- Forgot username and password
   Refreshes and asked for email address to resend username or sends password
