Deliverable three required three things:
A diagram for one of our user stories (we chose authentication)
The steps of the happy path of the user story
Our reasons for selecting the framework we were using (we used Django)
These three files are included in the Deliverable_3_First folder. The Deliverable_3_Final folder contains two files, one for the happy path revision and one for the diagram revision. The reasons for selecting the framework do not change (because it wouldn't make sense to change our reasons for initially choosing a framework after we've selected it). These two revisions show how our first drafts changed for our final product.
