Happy Paths Revised:
1A: Chooses local account / 1B: Chooses Facebook
2A: Authentication request sent to database / 2B: Request app 
3A: Returns token, authenticated with local credentials / 3B: Return app token
(4-6 if choosing Facebook):
   4: Redirected to home page
   5: Facebook requests Login token
   6: Authenticated through Facebook
7: Store session ID
8: Complete --> Redirect with session


Some things that could go wrong:

1- No account
Solution: Refreshes, gives an error and asks to login with correct credentials or sign up page
2- Incorrect password or username
Solution:Refreshes and allows re-enter of both.
