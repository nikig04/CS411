Happy Paths Revised:
1A: Chooses local account / 1B: Chooses Facebook
2A: Authentication request sent to database / 2B: Request app 
3A: Returns token, authenticated with local credentials / 3B: Return app token
(4-6 if choosing Facebook):
4: Redirected to home page
5: Facebook requests Login roken
6: Authenticated through Facebook
7: Store session ID
8: Complete --> Redirect with session


Somethings that could go wrong:

1- No account
   Refreshes, gives an error and asks to login with correct credentials or sign up page
2- Incorrect password or username
   Refreshes and allows re-enter of both.
