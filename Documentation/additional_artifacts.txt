Plans for a future version
If we had had more time or more experience, we would have implemented some more features that we originally wanted but were unable to get to. These are plans for a future version:
- First of all, our app is not on a live server, which would be really cool if we could do. We didn't want to spend any money or have to figure out this additional step since it wasn't necessary for completion.
- Second, we would like to  allow users to add the ingredients from each recipe into a list, so that they can have a list that is generated by the app that contains all of their necessary ingredients. 
We feel as if this would make the app more of a full product, as it allows you to get all the way to the final requirement for grocery shopping within the app, which is a list of what you're actually going to buy. 
Currently, you have to copy and paste the ingredients if you want them, which isn't as good as having the app do it for you.
- We would also like to implement a way for users to save recipes that they liked, so they can click on something like a "favorite recipes" button and see all of the recipes that they liked.
- Lastly, we would like to include filtering for different cuisines, instead of just dietary restrictions. Things like "mexican" or "italian" would be useful to allow users to get the most out of the app based on their cravings.

Planning and assigning tasks
Our team primarily used google docs as a way to keep track of all our tasks. We communicated through a Facebook group to set up things like meetings or talk about what else needed to be done. When we had meetings, we assigned tasks to different team mates
depending on their skillset. Link to one of our google docs as an example:

*Testing*
We tested our final product essentially by trying to break it by going down an unhappy path. After we thought we had working fields, we would try and input unexpected inputs into each field to see if we could somehow cause bugs in things like the auth or the recipe search. 
We found a few bugs like this, for example if a user just tried to search without entering a zip code, it would cause an error, so we had to fix things like that.


Overall, the project went pretty well, we did a good job of planning ahead of time and keeping on task so we felt prepared the whole way through. We ran into some issues with estimating how long things would take; for example, auth turned out to be much harder than we thought
it would be, so some people ended up working for longer than others did after we had planned tasks. Overall though, we feel like we did a good job, since we came into this with no experience with Django or how to make a web app.
